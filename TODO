* Add command line options.

After a year, I have better ideas on how to structure this code.

I have an abstract syntax of JSP and several concrete repsentations:

* Lisp-like
* Dot
* Python-like
* Regex

Each of these forms should be organized as separate packages. Each package would have conversion:

toAst    :: Concrete -> AST
fromAst  :: AST -> Concrete

The packages supply one of these conversions.

Lisp-like:

 toAst :: Lisp -> AST
 fromAst :: AST -> Lisp

Some packages only supply one conversion. There is no need to convert dot to ast.
